# Arabic Text Toolkit

A Python library for processing Arabic text, including methods for diacritization, phonemization, and removing diacritics. The toolkit is designed to handle Arabic text and convert it into a phonemic representation following the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) standards.

## Features

- **Diacritization**: Automatically adds diacritics (harakats) to Arabic text using a pre-trained model.
- **Phonemization**: Converts Arabic text into a sequence of phonemes, conforming to IPA standards.
- **Diacritics Removal**: Strips diacritical marks from Arabic text, making it easier to handle unvocalized text.
